* uFluidics Counter Project
This repository is the code for the EE4400 uFluidics Counting Project,
for the dsPIC33fj128gp802. To build, make sure MPLAB X and XC16 are
installed, then run 'make'.

** Specifications
   - Analog input signal 200mv pk, unknown waveform
   - Amplified to some level 700mv pk?
   - Sampled at 10kHz
   - Cells counted somehow

** TODO List [0%]
   - [-] Test the features of the chip [60%]
     - [X] ADC
     - [X] UART
     - [X] SPI
     - [ ] DMA [0/2]
       - [ ] SPI
       - [ ] ADC
     - [ ] 80MHz Clock
   - [ ] Create A mini oscilloscope
   - [ ] Collect simulated waveform
   - [ ] Analyze simulated data in matlab, determine best counting method
     - [ ] FFT amplitude
     - [ ] Correlation + threshold
   - [ ] Program above solution on dsp
