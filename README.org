[[./data/data4.png]]

A small piece of nail dropped through a straw, 5kHz

* Characterization
** With Two cubic magnets
   - 58mV output from coil
   - 30 turns around straw
   - Straw
     - 5.3mm diameter
     - 
   - ??T field strength
     - Can calculate
     - Measure with hall effect sensor

* Amplifier
** Specifications
   - needs gain of 400mV/600nV=660,000
   - Uses AD8428 as low noise input amplifier (g=2000)
   - Uses ADa4528 as final amplifier
     - Feedback resistors set for g=330, Rf=33k, Rg=100\Omega
   - +- 5V power supply
     - May need to do some scaling with a third amp to feed to DSP
** Simulation
   - Outputs 300mV pk/pk for 300nVpk/pk input
   - 1/f Noise at 50mV
